<h1>Hello MIT fellow cohorts</h1>
<div class="text">
    I wanted to show the code here for linking a css stylesheet and how to make
    a flex box so the position of the text and images are aesthetically pleasing
    with an easy user interface, plus simple code. That is why this text is in a 
    div class, the link and image will be in one as well.
</div>
<div class="image">
    <img class="image1" src="images/Gotta_fix_the_code.jpg" alt="a trippy image of a city pixelated">
</div>
<div class="image_text">
    I made this image as a part of a NFT project I created last year, it is called
    gotta_fix_the_code. I figured it would be fitting for this exercise.
